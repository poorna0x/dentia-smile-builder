      question: 'How often should I visit the dentist?',
      answer: 'We recommend visiting the dentist every 6 months for routine cleanings and checkups. However, some patients may need more frequent visits based on their individual oral health needs. Regular visits help prevent problems and catch issues early when they\'re easier to treat.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I expect during my first visit?',
      answer: 'During your first visit, we\'ll conduct a comprehensive examination including X-rays, oral cancer screening, and assessment of your teeth and gums. We\'ll discuss your medical history, current concerns, and develop a personalized treatment plan. The visit typically takes 60-90 minutes.'
    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: 'What age should children start seeing a dentist?',
      answer: 'Children should have their first dental visit by age 1 or within 6 months after their first tooth appears. Early visits help establish good oral hygiene habits, prevent problems, and ensure proper dental development. We make pediatric visits fun and comfortable.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I maintain good oral health at home?',
      answer: 'Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, use an antimicrobial mouthwash, eat a balanced diet low in sugary snacks, and avoid tobacco products. Regular dental visits complement your home care routine for optimal oral health.'
